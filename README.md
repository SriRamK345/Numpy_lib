The NumPy library is the core library for scientific computing in Python. 
It provides a high-performance multidimensional array
 object, and tools for
working with these arrays


## Creating array

>>> a = np.array([1,2,3])
>>> b = np.array([(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)], dtype = float)
>>> c = np.array([[(1.5,2,3), (4,5,6)],[(3,2,1), (4,5,6)]], dtype = float)
